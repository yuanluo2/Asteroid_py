首先非常感谢youtube博主 GrandmaCan 的优秀视频 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61eX0bFAsYs
这个项目是一步步跟着他的教学编写的，我更改了部分代码逻辑，加入了一些注释，素材我也做了部分的改动。另外，在他的基础上，我加入了游戏的暂停功能。
##### 整个游戏通过左右方向键控制，按下空格可以发射子弹，Esc键可以暂停游戏。游戏中会出现2种道具，盾牌可以回血，闪电可以增加子弹的发出数量，最大上限为3颗。
##### 你初始拥有3条生命，你需要通过移动来规避陨石群并击破它们已得到更高的分数。

First of all, thank you very much to YouTube blogger GrandmaCan for his excellent video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61eX0bFAsYs
This project was written step by step following his teaching. I made some changes to the code logic, added some comments, and made some changes to the resources. Additionally, based on his foundation, I have added a pause function to the game.
##### The entire game is controlled by the left and right arrow keys. Pressing the space key can shoot, and the Esc key can pause the game. There will be two types of props in the game, shields can heal, lightning can increase the number of bullets, with a maximum limit of 3.
##### You initially have 3 lives, and you need to move to avoid the meteorite cluster and defeat them to get a higher score.
